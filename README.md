# Game-220-Project-1
Game Scene Remix

## Assignment

Add new sounds to your favorite video game cutscene. Using Pro Tools, add completely new sound effects, dialogue and music to a video game cutscene of your choice. 

## Process

### Finding Videos

The easiest way to find a video file to use is to download it from youtube. I suggest using [yt-download](https://www.yt-download.org/file/mp4/JnQrVKNvqqI). You should be able to download an MP4 file.

### Using Videos in Pro Tools
- Importing [Tutorial Video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=_CL7OybUTBE&feature=emb_log)
    - Open Pro Tools
    - Select "File" -> "Import"
    - Select your video file

- Bouncing [Tutorual Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZfrd0NJt9k)
    - Select video clip in pro tools track lane view 
    - Select "File" --> "Bounce to"
    - This will render a new version of the video with your new audio

## Delivering Video
Git isn't the best at handling large binary files like videos, so you have a couple options for submitting video:

- Clone this repo, add you video file to your repo, submit a PR
- Submit your video to an online hosting platform, clone this repo, paste the link in this README and submit a PR
  - Because you'll be using copywritten work, I suggest you set the video to private and send me an invite to view.
- Bring your video file into class on a USB thumbstick and/or hardrive, I'll physically transfer it to my machine.
